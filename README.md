## Iris Flower Classification Project

### Description

This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three distinct species: **Iris-setosa**, **Iris-versicolor**, and **Iris-virginica**. The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to accurately classify the species of a flower based on these measurements.

### Function

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    
    - Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
    - Visualize the data using various plots such as pair plots, histograms, and heatmaps to identify patterns and correlations between features.
    - Clean and prepare the data by handling any missing values and normalizing the features if necessary.
2. **Model Training**:
    
    - Train a machine learning model using the cleaned dataset. Various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines can be used to build the classification model.
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the training data and tune hyperparameters to optimize accuracy.
3. **Model Testing**:
    
    - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to validate the model's performance.
    - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
    - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure it performs well on unseen data.
